Texticize is very flexible, giving users complete control over template processing through the Configuration object which can be used to override the default vocabulary and even the processing pipeline.  Even with this flexibility, there will be instances when you would want to extend Texticize to deal with new use cases.  The extensible design of Texticize allows you to extend it's functionality by creating new macros, template readers, substitution processors, and even template processors that orchestrate the entire workflow.
